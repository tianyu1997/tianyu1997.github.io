I am currently a third-year PhD student in the Department of Electronic Engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, under the supervision of Professor Ren Hongliang. My main research areas are obstacle avoidance planning for redundant robots and imitation learning in robotics.

I obtained my Bachelor's and Master's degrees from the Department of Automation at Tsinghua University under the guidance of Professor Wang Xueqian in 2019 and 2022, respectively.
